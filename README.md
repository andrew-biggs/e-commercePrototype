#E-CommercePrototype
This is a body massage themed web-based application. This application implements basic HTML, CSS, JSP, and JSTL concepts. The functionality of this application uses sessions, filters, servlets and classes. The initial idea of this web application is to simulate an e-commerce website that offers users a selection of massage services. To begin, a user must first create an account/login by providing user information. Once successfully logged in, the user will be allowed to access a “Services” page in which they will select from one of four offered services. Once a service is selected, they will be directed to an “Appointment” page that displays their selected service. Then the user can either continue shopping, or checkout. The checkout page displays all selected services and prices. The user can then logout which will terminate the session and redirect them to the login page.
User cannot visit any other page besides login/create account page without first logging in.
